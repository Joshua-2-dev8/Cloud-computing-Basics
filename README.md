# AWS EC2 Instance Pricing Estimation
This document provides an overview of the process for estimating the cost of Amazon EC2 instances using the AWS Pricing Calculator. It also explains why the costs of these services vary by region.
## Overview
The AWS Pricing Calculator is a tool that allows users to estimate the cost of AWS services, including Amazon EC2 instances. The tool helps users configure and calculate the costs based on their specific requirements, such as instance type, region, and usage patterns.
 Process of Estimating an EC2 Instance
1. Create an Estimate:
   - Start by creating a new estimate in the AWS Pricing Calculator.
   - Provide a description for your estimate to keep track of different configurations.
2. Choose a Region:
Select the AWS region where you plan to deploy your EC2 instance. The region can significantly impact the cost due to varying pricing structures and availability of instance types.
   - Examples of regions used are:
     - US East (Ohio)
     - US West (N. California)
3. Add and Configure Services:
   - Add the EC2 service to your estimate.
   - Configure the service by selecting the instance type, such as `t4g.nano` or `t3.large`, based on your requirements.
   - Specify the number of vCPUs, memory, and network performance.

4. Review Estimated Costs:
The calculator will provide an estimated upfront cost and monthly cost based on your configuration.
  For example:
  - Total Upfront cost: $0.00 USD
     -Total Monthly cost: $3.65 USD (for US East (Ohio)) or $3.07 USD (for US West (N. California))
 ## Why Does Costs Vary by Region?
The cost of EC2 instances can vary significantly depending on the AWS region selected. Several factors contribute to these variations:
1. Infrastructure Costs:
   - The cost of maintaining data centers, including electricity, cooling, and physical security, varies by region.
2. Local Market Conditions:
   - Economic factors, such as local labor costs and taxes, can influence pricing.
3. Demand and Supply:
- Regions with higher demand for specific instance types may have higher prices due to limited   availability.

4. Currency Exchange Rates:
- Pricing in different regions may be affected by currency exchange rates, especially for regions outside the United States.

 ## Example Configurations Used  Document
Region: US East (Ohio)
Chosen Instance: t4g.nano
Family: t4g
vCPUs: 2
Memory: 0.5 GiB
Total Monthly Cost: $3.65 USD

Region:US West (N. California)
Chosen Instance: t4g.nano
Family: t4g
vCPUs: 2
Memory: 0.5 GiB
Total Monthly Cost: $3.07 USD

## Comparison and Inferences 
1.  Cost Variation by Region:
o   The monthly cost for the same EC2 instance type (t4g.nano) is 3.65USD in USEast(Ohio) and 3.65USD in USEast (Ohio) and 3.07 USD in US West (N. California).
o   This indicates a cost difference of $0.58 USD per month between the two regions.
2.  Reasons for Cost Differences:
o   Infrastructure Costs: The cost of maintaining data centers, including electricity, cooling, and physical security, can vary significantly between regions. US West (N. California) might have lower infrastructure costs compared to US East (Ohio), contributing to the lower price.
o   Local Market Conditions: Economic factors such as local labor costs, taxes, and regulatory requirements can influence pricing. California might have different economic conditions compared to Ohio, affecting the overall cost.
o   Demand and Supply: Regions with higher demand for specific instance types may have higher prices due to limited availability. If US East (Ohio) has higher demand for t4g.nano instances, this could drive up the price.
o   Currency Exchange Rates: Although both regions are within the United States, any regional economic factors that indirectly affect pricing could also play a role.
3.  Strategic Implications:
o   Cost Savings: Deploying resources in US West (N. California) could result in cost savings of $0.58 USD per month per instance compared to US East (Ohio). For large-scale deployments with many instances, this difference could add up significantly over time.
